Introduction to GitHub Actions and Cl/ CD Course Project


Lesson 1: Understanding Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment


Objectives:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Define Cl/CD and understand its benefits.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Get familiar with the Cl/CD pipeline.

Lesson Details:

1. Definition and Benefits of Cl/CD:

- Continuous Integration (Cl) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
- Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of releasing software changes to production automatically and reliably.
- Benefits: Faster release rate, improved developer productivity, better code quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

2. Overview of the Cl/CD Pipeline:

- Cl Pipeline typically includes steps like version control, code integration, automated testing, and building the application.
- CD Pipeline involves steps like deploying the application to a staging or production environment, and post-deployment monitoring.



# Lesson 1: Understanding Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

**Objectives:**

1. ﻿﻿﻿Define Cl/CD and understand its benefits.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Get familiar with the CI/CD pipeline.


Lesson Details:

1. Definition and Benefits of CI/CD:

- Continuous Integration (Cl) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
- Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of releasing software changes to production automatically and reliably.
- Benefits: Faster release rate, improved developer productivity, better code quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

2. Overview of the Cl/CD Pipeline:

- Cl Pipeline typically includes steps like version control, code integration, automated testing, and building the application.
- CD Pipeline involves steps like deploying the application to a staging or production environment, and post-deployment monitoring.
- Tools: Version control systems (e.g., Git), CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions), testing frameworks, and deployment tools.

# Lesson 2: Introduction to GitHub Actions

**Objectives:**

1. ﻿﻿﻿Understand what GitHub Actions is.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Learn key concepts and terminology.

Lesson Details:

- GitHub Actions: A CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub, automating the build, test, and deployment pipelines of your software directly within your GitHub repository.
- Documentation Reference: Explore the GitHub Actions Documentation for in-depth understanding.


# Key Concepts and Terminology:

1. Workflow:
- Definition: A configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file in your repository.
- Example: A workflow to test and deploy a Node.js application upon a Git push.
- Documentation: Learn more about workflows in the GitHub Docs on Workflows.

2. Event:
- Definition: A specific activity that triggers a workflow. Events include activities like push, pull request, issue creation, or even a scheduled time.
- Example: A 'push' event triggers a workflow that runs tests every time code is pushed to any branch in a repository.
- Documentation: Review different types of events in the Events that trigger workflows section.

3. Job:
- Definition: A set of steps in a workflow that are executed on the same runner. Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.
- Example: A job that runs tests on your application.
- Documentation: Understand jobs in detail in the GitHub Docs on Jobs.

4. Step:
- Definition: An individual task that can run commands within a job. Steps can run scripts or actions.
- Example: A step in a job to install dependencies ('npm install').
- Documentation: Learn about steps in the Steps section of GitHub Docs.
  
5. Action:
- Definition: Standalone commands combined into steps to create a job. Actions can be written by you or provided by the GitHub community.
- Example: Using 'actions/checkout' to check out your repository code.
- Documentation: Explore GitHub Actions in the Marketplace and learn how to create your own in the Creating actions guide.

6. Runner:
- Definition: A server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Runners can be hosted by GitHub or self-hosted
- Example: A GitHub-hosted runner that uses Ubuntu.
- Documentation: Delve into runners in the GitHub Docs on Runners.

# Practical Implementation

**Setting Up the Project:**

1. Initialize a GitHub Repository:

- Create a new repository on GitHub.

- Clone it to your local machine.

2. Create a Simple Node.js Application:

- Initialize a Node.js project ('npm init').

- Create a simple server using Express.js to serve a static web page.

```

// Example: index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

- Add your code to the repository and push it to GitHub
